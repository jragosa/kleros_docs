# Web Languages

## Long Live the Web

We are huge fans of the Web and Javascript community and regularly follow thought leaders, specially from the React team, to keep up to date with the latest best practices. However, we engineer for users, not other engineers, so we try to remain as pragmatic as possible.

That said, I think we still do pretty well with staying up to date, although I'm not sure for how long after this last ReactConf :\).

## Our Approach

There is no point in listing out a bunch of frameworks and linters here. In general, we follow the **"pick the best tool for the job philosophy"**. Check out [Kathari]() and [one of our dapps](https://github.com/kleros/doges-on-trial) to get a sense of what we think that is at the moment.
