# Archon: Ethereum Arbitration Standard API

Archon is a javascript library written to make it easy to interact with `Arbitrable` and `Arbitrator` contracts. In particular, Archon can be used to take care of a lot of the hash validation work that is part of the Evidence Standard \(ERC 1497\).

Archon can be used with all Arbitrable and Arbitrator contracts that follow the ERC 792 standard and has the functionality to interact with all standardized methods.

In the linked documentation, you will be guided through the use of the Archon library.
