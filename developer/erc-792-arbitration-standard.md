# ERC-792: Arbitration Standard

### Abstract

The ERC-792 - Arbitration Standard describes a standard of `Arbitrable` and `Arbitrator` contracts. Every Arbitrable contract can be adjudicated by every Arbitrator contract. Arbitrator contracts give rulings and Arbitrable contracts enforce them.

### Motivation

Using two contracts allows separation between the ruling and its enforcement. This abstraction allows `Arbitrable` contract developers not to have to know the internal process of the `Arbitrator` contracts. Neither do `Arbitrator` contract developers with `Arbitrable` ones.  
It allows dapps to easily switch from one arbitration service to another one. Or to allow their users to choose themselves their arbitration services.

In the linked documentation, you will be guided through the usage of this standard. We will implement some examples for `Arbitrable` and `Arbitrator` contracts.
