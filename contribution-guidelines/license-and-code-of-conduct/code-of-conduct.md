# Code of Conduct

## Be Decent

Decentralizing justice is not an easy or small task, so we need as many people as possible to chip in, and for that, everyone needs to feel comfortable and accepted.

Writing a full guide on what is considered decent behavior would be almost impossible. But, we can show some examples of positive and negative behavior. \(From the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org).\)

### Positive & Expected Behavior

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

### Negative & Unacceptable Behavior

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
